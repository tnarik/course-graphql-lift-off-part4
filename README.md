# Odyssey Lift-off IV: Mutations

Welcome to the companion app of Odyssey Lift-off IV! You can [find the course lessons and instructions on Odyssey](https://odyssey.apollographql.com/lift-off-part4), Apollo's learning platform.

You can [preview the completed demo app here](https://lift-off-client-demo.netlify.app/).

> The original repo is [here](https://github.com/apollographql/odyssey-lift-off-part4), and it might have been updated since following the course.
>
> To keep it up to date:
> ```
> git remote add upstream https://github.com/apollographql/odyssey-lift-off-part4
> git fetch upstream
> git diff main..upstream/main --name-only # shows files that diverge
> git pull --rebase upstream main
> git push -f
> ```
>
> I like creating a branch before this rebases, so that I can understand (perhaps more easily) the delta. I name them as `solution_<YYYY><MM><DD>`. This is because this repo is not a "fork", but an implementation/solution on top of the course.
>
> Additional updates would merit additional branches, which are then merged on top of "main"

## How to use this repo

The course will walk you step by step on how to implement the features you see in the demo app. This codebase is the starting point of your journey!

There are 3 main folders:

- `server`: The starting point of our GraphQL server.
- `client`: The starting point of our React application.
- `final`: The final stage of both the server and client folders, with all of the steps and code completed!

To get started:

1. Navigate to the `server` folder.
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm start`.

This will start the GraphQL API server.

In another Terminal window,

1. Navigate to the `client` folder.
1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm start`.

This will open up `localhost:3000` in your web browser.
